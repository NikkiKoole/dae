#Dae - Ain't (a Game Engine) Either

This is my first project with SDL2 and the D language,
I am new to both, there's no doubt this will be mediocre at best!

accelerated 2d graphics and a game framework that works on tiny ARM devices (like the RPi)
Using existing tools: 
- texturepacker tool http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker I use the free https://github.com/krzysztof-o/spritesheet.js which writes the same format.
- bmfont bitmap font http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/
- tiled tilemap editor http://www.mapeditor.org/

At the moment I have implemented these file formats (except the tiled one) and am just struggling with SDL2.
